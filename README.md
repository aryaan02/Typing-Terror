LAUNCHING THE GAME

For Windows users:
Unzip the "TypingTerrorPC" folder, go into the "TypingTerrorPC" folder, and double-click the executable file named "Typing Terror". From here, the game 
will launch in a separate window and be ready for you to play.

For MacOS users:
To start the game, unzip the "TypingTerrorMac.app.zip" file. Then, double click the application named "TypingTerrorMac". The game should launch in a separate window and 
be ready for you to play.
	***If your Mac gives you an error message and it is not able to open, close the error message. Then, right click the application, click "Open", and when a pop-up comes up,
 	click "Open" once more. The game should launch properly now! 

PLAYING THE GAME

Once the game loads in, the main menu will present you with three options: "PLAY", "HOW TO PLAY", and "QUIT". 
- Click "HOW TO PLAY" if you would like to know the basis of how to play the game. 
- Click "QUIT" if you would like to quit the game.
- Click "PLAY" to start the game.
   
Once the game starts, you will see three houses at the bottom, a score in the top left of the screen, and boulders starting to fall out of the sky. Type the words written on the boulders to destroy them, and do not let them reach the houses. If the boulders reach all three houses, you will lose. 
If all houses are destroyed, the game will take you to a losing screen, with a message saying "YOU LOSE" and two options: "PLAY AGAIN" and "QUIT".
- Click "PLAY AGAIN" if you would like to play the game again.
- Click "QUIT" if you are done playing and would like to close the application.

ACCESSING BEHIND-THE-SCENES CODE

- You can access the scripts through Visual Studio Code by unzipping the "TypingTerrorProject" file located in the Google Drive folder. Then, navigate to /Assets/Scripts, and all of the code files will be found there. If you right click any "C# Source File" file in that directory, and choose "Open With" and "Visual Studio", the code should load up in Visual Studio.

- You will need to install Unity in order to open the project file to see the scripts and their interactions with the GameObjects. To install Unity, follow this link: https://unity.com/download
- Follow the installer instructions until you have successfully installed the Unity Hub. Once Unity Hub is installed and open, you will have to sign in or create a Unity account by clicking on the profile icon on the top left of Unity Hub. 
- Once you are signed into the Unity Hub, you can click on the Installs tab on the left side, and then click "Install Editor" on the top right. Install the latest "LTS (Long Term Support)" version available.
- Once the editor is successfully installed, locate my "TypingTerrorProject" file and unzip it. Go to the Projects tab in Unity Hub, click on the "Open" button at the top, and open the unzipped folder titled "TypingTerrorProject". Once everything is loaded in, a screen with a scene view of my project and the rest of the assets should be visible in the Unity Editor UI.
